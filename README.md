# THIS IS A TEST BRANCH!
I put new features here before deciding if I want to implement them in the main branch.

# Build Game from Source (Windows)

My preferred method for creating an exe or other file is using PyInstaller. Instructions for installing PyInstaller can be found [here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/installation.html).

Once you have PyInstaller, use `pyinstaller --onefile dungeoncrawlergame.py` to create an application for the game. 

This specific command will create the application in one file, and I strongly recommend doing it this way.
